# Wine Quality Prediction 

The goal of this project is to predict the wine quality using different machine learning algorithms and to conclude which algorithm gives high accuracy.

	


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project **winequality-red.csv** has  different features which affect the wine quality.we obtained the dataset from kaggle.

## Environment
We used **Python 3.6** for this project and implemented the code in **Jupyter Notebook**

## Code

The code for this project is written in Python.Code is availaible in `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`.

## Results

Our model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set. The detailed results are presented below.

## Conclusion

The study aimed to create a machine learning model for predicting wine quality using fewer features and tests. The study used four classification techniques,In which Random forest and Logistic regression yiels good accuracy.
